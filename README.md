##  Flow-Cycle

A guide to a woman's menstruation cycle as well as the time taken to get her next periods.
Also we have been focussing on the women health and hygiene so that they donot face any problem in her upcoming periods.
<p> We also focussed on pregnancy and the time when they might get the most pregnant. To educate the women about the ovulation cycle and menstrual cycle, we have created a different section.</p>

<p> We are up for any suggetions and any additional features which is not there. </p>

<p> Disclaimer: Flow cycle is an attempt to make a web version of popular app flow, (With fair intent of only practicing ). </p>
